* This mod allows condition recovery from *Improved Rest* Buff when **Condition Recovery During Rest** is set to *none* (Custom Mode).
* This particular setting usually makes *Herbal Teas* (and few *recipes*) almost useless.

* Ideal for players who prefer tough playthroughs but still want some healing options like birch bark teas.
* This mod uses the vanilla values of each items (https://thelongdark.fandom.com/wiki/Improved_Rest).
* This mod will not interfere in other sandbox if **Condition Recovery During Rest** is set to anything else than *none*
